# Whole Genome Sequencing analysis

This folder contains all the code related to the analysis of the Whole Genome Sequencings (WGS).  
Contains these 3 folders:
1. ```tumor_vs_blood```: Analysis related to somatic variant calling using only blood as the normal-matched sample.  
2. ```case3_normal_tissues```: Analysis related to the somatic variant calling using several normal tissues from case 3.
3. ```case3_clones_analysis```: Analysis related to the somatic variant calling on the clones derived from the malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) of case 3, using blood as the normal-matched sample.
