# Mutational signature analysis of clones from tumor2 (MRT) case 3

- ```Analysis_msigact_clones_case3_t2.ipynb```: Notebook to create the input table for mSigAct and to create the figure plots.
- ```./input/```: folder to save the table used as input for msigact (clonal mutations).
- ```./msigact/```: folder to execute msigact scripts. Follow the instructions in the ```commands.txt``` file.
- ```./figures_paper/```: folder to save the plots for the paper.
  - **Figure 3C**: venn diagramm of MRT, clone1 and clone2; and mutational signature anlaysis (2 bar plots, platinum vs. other).
  - **Supplementary Figure S6C**: mutational signature analysis (stacked bar plots), SBS31 and SBS35.
